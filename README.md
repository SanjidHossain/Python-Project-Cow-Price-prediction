# Python-Project-Cow-Price-prediction

This repository contains code for analyzing cow prices based on their weight and color. The code performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and generates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between weight and price. It also predicts prices using Linear regression


## Results

The code generates a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between cow weight and price. Each point on the plot represents a cow, and the color of the points corresponds to the cow's color. The plot helps in understanding how weight and color affect the price of cows. Apart from this,  `Linear regression` has been used for price prediction. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is stored in the file `python_data.csv`. It contains information about cows, including their color, weight in kilograms, and price.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/SanjidHossain/Python-Project-Cow-Price-prediction.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```
cd cow-price-detection
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the code:

```
python cow_price_detection.ipynb
```

Make sure to have the dataset `python_data.csv` in the same directory as the script.
